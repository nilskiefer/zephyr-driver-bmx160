# BMX-160 Absolute Orientation Sensor Release Notes

This library provides functions for interfacing with the BMX-160 I2C/SPI 16-bit Absolute Orientation Sensor with three axis accelerometer, three axis gyroscope, and three axis magnetometer as used on the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield.

### What's Included?
* APIs for initializing/de-initializing the driver
* APIs for reading the accelerometer
* APIs for reading the gyroscope
* APIs for reading the magnetometer
* API for testing the sensor

### What Changed?
#### v1.0.2
* Fixed a bug that could cause pointer corruption when using ISRs
* Added bash script to patch the BMI160 library to allow it to be used with the BMX-160 Device ID
#### v1.0.1
* Added support for using with HAL v1 or v2
#### v1.0.0
* Initial release
