/**
 * \addtogroup group_board_libs Absolute Orientation Sensor
 * \{
 * Basic set of APIs for interacting with the BMX160 absolute orientation
 * sensor. This provides basic initialization and access to to the basic
 * accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. It also provides access to
 * the base BMI160 & BMM150 driver for full control.
 * For more information about the motion sensor, see:
 * https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMI160_driver
 * For more information about the magnetometer sensor, see:
 * https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMM150-Sensor-API
 *
 * \note Currently, this library only supports being used for a single instance
 * of this device.
 *
 * \note BMX160 support requires delays. If the RTOS_AWARE component is set or
 * CY_RTOS_AWARE is defined, the HAL driver will defer to the RTOS for delays.
 * Because of this, it is not safe to call any functions other than
 * \ref mtb_bmx160_init_i2c until after the RTOS scheduler has started.
 *
 * \note There is a known issue with the BMI160 endianness detection. Any code
 * referencing the structures defined in the BMI160 driver should have this header
 * file, mtb_bmx160.h, first in any includes.
 *
 * \section subsection_board_libs_snippets Code snippets
